## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Reviews were scraped from Google Play Store.
2. **Preprocessing**: Included cleaning text, removing HTML tags, and normalization.
3. **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF and custom sentiment lexicons (HowNet, NTUSD, iSGoPaSD).
4. **Word Embedding**: Word2Vec (CBOW and Skip-gram).
5. **Model Training**:
   - Traditional ML: Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
   - Deep Learning: Bi-LSTM with Keras
6. **Evaluation**: Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
